Task 3: Kubernetes
I have successfully executed Task 3, which involved setting up a Kubernetes environment for my application. Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed and how I accomplished them:
 
**1. Ensure Docker Installation:**
   Before diving into Kubernetes, I ensured that Docker was properly installed and configured on my local machine. This is a crucial prerequisite for containerizing my application.
 
**2. Generate Dockerfile:**
   To containerize my Java application, I created a Dockerfile. Here's the Dockerfile content I used:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
   COPY target/my-application.jar my-application
   ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/my-application.jar"]
   ```
   This Dockerfile is configured to use the official Java 8 image as a base, copy my application's JAR file into the image, and set the entry point for running my application.
 
**3. Build the Docker Image:**
   To create a Docker image for my application, I executed the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-application .
   ```
   This command builds a Docker image tagged as "my-application" using the Dockerfile and the application JAR file.
 
**4. Create Deployment Configuration (deployment.yaml):**
   To orchestrate the deployment of my application in Kubernetes, I crafted a Deployment configuration in a YAML file named `deployment.yaml`. Here's the content of that file:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
      name: my-application-deployment
   spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
         matchLabels:
            app: my-application
      template:
         metadata:
            labels:
               app: my-application
   ```
   This configuration specifies the desired state for my application, including the number of replicas and label selectors.
 
**5. Create Service Configuration (service.yaml):**
   To expose my application to external traffic, I created a Kubernetes Service using a YAML file named `service.yaml`. Here's the content of that file:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
      name: my-application-service
   spec:
      selector:
         app: my-application
      ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: 80
           targetPort: 8080
      type: LoadBalancer
   ```
   This Service configuration defines how external traffic should be routed to my application, including the use of a LoadBalancer type.
 
By meticulously following these steps, I have successfully containerized my Java application with Docker and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster. This approach ensures the scalability and availability of my application while exposing it to external access through a LoadBalancer Service.
