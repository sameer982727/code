I have successfully implemented the `getServerByName` method and configured the MongoDB connection in my Spring Boot application by following these steps:
**Configuring the MongoDB Connection:**
To set up the MongoDB connection, I began by editing the `application.properties` file and adding the following configurations:
```properties
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
spring.data.mongodb.database=db_name
```
I made sure to replace `db_name` with the actual name of my MongoDB database.
 
**Implementing the `getServerByName` Method:**
For the core functionality of finding a server by its name, I made changes to my `ServerRepository` interface by introducing the following method declaration:
```java
Server findByName(String name);
```
This method definition allows me to search for a `Server` instance based on its name.
 
**Updating the ServerController Class:**
In order to integrate the new functionality into the application, I ensured that the `ServerRepository` dependency was properly injected into the `ServerController` class, if it wasn't already.
Subsequently, I introduced a new method within the `ServerController` class to handle the retrieval of a server by name using a GET request:
```java
@GetMapping("/name/{name}")
public Server getServerByName(@PathVariable String name) {
    return serverRepository.findByName(name);
}
```
This method is designed to map a GET request with the URL pattern `/name/{name}` and then employs the `findByName` method from the `ServerRepository` to fetch the server by its name.
 
By following these steps, I have now successfully implemented the `getServerByName` method and established the MongoDB connection configuration within my Spring Boot application. I can validate this implementation by making a GET request to `/api/servers/name/{name}`, replacing `{name}` with the desired server name.
