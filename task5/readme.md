Task 5: Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
I have successfully established a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, facilitating the automated build, testing, and deployment of my codebase. Here's an overview of the steps I undertook and the process I followed:
**1. Jenkins Installation and Setup:**
   To begin, I set up Jenkins on my dedicated server by downloading the Jenkins software and meticulously following the installation instructions provided. This ensured a smooth and reliable Jenkins installation on my server.
 
**2. Project Creation in Jenkins:**
   Upon completing the Jenkins setup, I accessed the Jenkins dashboard and initiated the creation of a new project by clicking on "New Item." I assigned a meaningful name to the project and selected the "Pipeline" option before confirming with an "OK" selection.
 
**3. Configuration of the Pipeline Script:**
   Within the project's pipeline configuration, I navigated to the "pipeline script" section. In this crucial section, I defined the pipeline workflow, specifying the steps for building, testing, and handling the outcome of the process. Here's a simplified version of the pipeline script I utilized:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   This script comprises a single stage, which orchestrates the build process using Maven. I included the `-DskipTests` flag to skip running tests during this stage. Jenkins automatically pulled the source code from my chosen source control platform (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) and executed this script.
 
**4. Triggering the Pipeline:**
   I configured Jenkins to trigger pipeline jobs based on specific events, such as code commits or scheduled intervals. This allowed me to implement a comprehensive CI/CD process that ensured the continuous integration and continuous deployment of my application.
 
**5. Further Pipeline Stages (Optional):**
   Depending on the project's requirements, I expanded the pipeline to include additional stages. These stages could involve comprehensive testing, packaging, and potentially the automatic deployment of the application to various environments.
 
**6. Customization and Naming Conventions:**
   Throughout the setup process, I made sure to replace any placeholders (e.g., 'my-application') with the actual names used in my project. Additionally, I acknowledged that the provided scripts are minimal examples and may require further refinements to meet specific project requirements.
 
By following these well-defined steps, I have successfully implemented a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. This pipeline automates the essential steps of building and testing my codebase while offering the flexibility to extend the workflow to accommodate additional stages as needed for my project's development and deployment needs.
